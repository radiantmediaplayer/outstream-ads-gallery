## Complying with the [Initial Better Ads Standards](https://www.betterads.org/standards/) from the Coalition for Better Ads
Auto-playing outstream video advertisement with sound is a least preferred ad experience for both desktop and mobile 
web. As such when autoplay of outstream video advertisement is requested with Radiant Media Player it defaults to muted autoplay. See [our docs](https://www.radiantmediaplayer.com/docs/latest/outstream-video-ads.html#player-settings) for more information.
